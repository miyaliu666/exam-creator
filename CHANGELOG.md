  - [x] Maximum answer variability and minimum answer variability
- Show variability in Exam Page
- [x] highlight sets/questions/answers that are not in any generations

For the sets A and B, the variability is the ratio of the size of the symmetric difference to the size of the union:

$$
\text{variability} = \frac{|A \Delta B|}{|A \cup B|} = \frac{|A - B| + |B - A|}{|A \cup B|}
$$
